# webpack-merge - Merge designed for Webpack

**webpack-merge** provides a `merge` function that concatenates arrays and merges objects creating a new object. If functions are encountered, it will execute them, run the results through the algorithm, and then wrap the returned values within a function again.

This behavior is particularly useful in configuring webpack although it has uses beyond it. Whenever you need to merge configuration objects, **webpack-merge** can come in handy.

## **`merge(...configuration | [...configuration])`**

`merge` is the core, and the most important idea, of the API. Often this is all you need unless you want further customization.

```javascript
const { merge } = require('webpack-merge');

// Default API
const output = merge(object1, object2, object3, ...);

// You can pass an array of objects directly.
// This works with all available functions.
const output = merge([object1, object2, object3]);

// Keys matching to the right take precedence:
const output = merge(
  { fruit: "apple", color: "red" },
  { fruit: "strawberries" }
);
console.log(output);
// { color: "red", fruit: "strawberries"}
```

### Limitations

Note that `Promise`s are not supported! If you want to return a configuration wrapp
